# Meta Pot
MetaPot is a plant-like device that visualizes the physiological responses of group work participants in real time through the movement and color change of leaves. 
By placing the MetaPot within group work, this research looks at how metacognition of oneself's and group members' mental efforts changes conversational turn taking behaviour
and improve group work quality.

## Requirements
* Arduino
* Pulse Sensor <http://pulsesensor.com/>
* Pupil headset from Pupil Labs <https://pupil-labs.com/pupil/>
* Python (to get data from Pupil real time and to send it to Arduino via UDP)
* Kinect V2
* Visual Studio (I used Express 2012 for Desktop)
* Jupyter Notebook (for data analysis)
* Bio Metal Fiber <http://www.toki.co.jp/biometal/products/bmf/bmf.php>
* some transistors and resistors to increase electric current
* (optional) JINS MEME <https://jins-meme.com/>
* Unity (not necessary, but you can use the code here to visualize tree movement on screen too, usuing Procedural Tree from Wasabimole)
